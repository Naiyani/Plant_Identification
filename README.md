# Exploring Plant Identification through image Processing using Machine learning techniques
Plants are the most important and primary food resource of many living things like humans, birds, 
animals, insects, etc.  We know that there are numerous 
types of plant species available on the earth. Identifying the name of those plants manually is time consuming. Automating this using a Classification algorithm will help Biologists, Students, 
environmentalists, etc. in various ways.
- The system will ensure people can identify plants without 
having flipping through research papers or books. Those plants that are similar to one another can be 
recognized easily.
- Using convolutional neural network to recognize plant can help the public gain more 
awareness towards plants species. Using the traditional convolutional neural network for the training 
of model to recognize plants.
