# Exploring Plant Identification through image Processing using Machine learning techniques
Plants are the most important and primary food resource for many living things like humans, birds, 
animals, insects, etc.  We know that there are numerous 
types of plant species available on the earth. Identifying the names of those plants manually is time-consuming. Automating this using a Classification algorithm will help Biologists, Students, 
environmentalists, etc. in various ways.
- The system will ensure people can identify plants without 
having to flip through research papers or books. Those plants that are similar to one another can be 
recognized easily.
- Using convolutional neural networks to recognize plants can help the public gain more 
awareness towards plant species. The traditional convolutional neural network trains the model to recognize plants.
